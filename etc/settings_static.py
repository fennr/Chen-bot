**How does it work?**
After enabling the policy, you can set different bounds for the different attributes (see below), these specify the percentage of confidence above which the bot should take action. If you would like to **disable an attribute**, simply set it to `1.0`, as no the probability will ever hit 100%.
‚Äã
**Available Attributes:**
`Toxicity` - A rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make people leave a discussion.
`Severe Toxicity` - A very hateful, aggressive, disrespectful comment or otherwise very likely to make a user leave a discussion or give up on sharing their perspective. This attribute is much less sensitive to more mild forms of toxicity, such as comments that include positive uses of curse words.
`Insult` - Insulting, inflammatory, or negative comment towards a person or a group of people.
`Profanity` - Swear words, curse words, or other obscene or profane language.
`Threat` - Describes an intention to inflict pain, injury, or violence against an individual or group.""",
